/**
 * Support class for the generation of thread heartbeats.
 *
 * The heartbeats are used to detect dead-locks and check that all threads are
 * still running. The threads protected by the heartbeats must send ticks through
 * the heartbeat topic in regular intervals.
 *
 * ## Timing
 *
 * As different threads have different timing constraints, the
 * heartbeat timing is defined by three durations:
 *
 * 1. Heartbeat interval
 * 2. Processing time
 * 3. Heartbeat tolerance
 *
 * The *heartbeat interval* defines the minimal time between two heartbeat
 * ticks. E.g. when a threads waits on a resource this would be the polling
 * interval. A default value is defined per project, but can be overwritten
 * for each thread.
 *
 * The *processing time* defines how long a thread might take to finish
 * the processing of its current task. This is different per thread and might
 * even be different per task the thread is processing.
 *
 * The *heartbeat tolerance* allows for some jitter in the processing time. In
 * a best-effort system this value can/should be higher than in a system with
 * tight real-time requirements. The value is defined by project and is always
 * added to the processing time.
 *
 * A typical example would be:
 * \code
 * while (1)
 * {
 *     Heartbeat::send(HeartbeatSource::task,
 *                     heartbeatInterval + heartbeatTolerance);
 *     if (newTaskSemaphore.acquire(heartbeatInterval))
 *     {
 *         while (hasNextTask())
 *         {
 *             Heartbeat::send(HeartbeatSource::task,
 *                             processingTime + heartbeatTolerance);
 *             doNextTask();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the thread only processes one task this might also be collapsed to:
 * \code
 * while (1)
 * {
 *     Heartbeat::send(HeartbeatSource::task,
 *                     heartbeatInterval + processingTime + heartbeatTolerance);
 *     if (newTaskSemaphore.acquire(heartbeatInterval))
 *     {
 *         // process task in less or equal than processingTime
 *         doTask();
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
